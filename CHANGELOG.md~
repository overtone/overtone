### Major Additions & Changes

#### apply-*

`apply-at` has been renamed to `apply-by` which more
 correctly represents its semantics as it applies the function *before*
 the specified time. `apply-at` still exists, except it now applies the
 fn *at* the specified time. To update, simply grep for all occurences of
 `apply-at` and replace with `apply-by`.

#### Synth Positioning

When triggering synths it was possible to specify a position for the
synth node to be executed in the node tree. This is important for
ensuring that synth chains are correctly ordered such that any post-fx
synths are executed after the source synth they are modifying. Prior to
0.9.0 this was possibly by prefixing the synth args with 'special'
values:

     (def my-g (group))
     (my-synth :tgt my-g :freq 440)

Overtone figured out that the `:tgt my-g` key-val pair were special, and
used them to target the synth node, and not pass them as params to the
synth along with the `:freq` param. This was slightly magical and also
potentially clashed with a synth designer's ability to use the special
keywords as valid synth param names.

This syntax has now been deprecated and replaced with a more explicit
vector-based syntax. If you wish to target your synth, you need to pass
a vector as the first parameter. The vector should be a pair of:

    [:target-specifier target]

Valid target specifiers are:

* `:head` - places new synth node at the head of the target (group)
* `:tail` - places new synth node at the tail of the target (group)
* `:before` - places new synth node immediately before target (group/synth)
* `:after` - places new synth node immediatedly after target (group/synth)
* `:replace` - replaces target with new synth node

Therefore, to place a new instance of `my-synth` at the head of `my-g`
you can issue the following:

    (my-synth [:head my-g] :freq 440)

Currently, you'll get an exception if you use the old style syntax. This
means that the old keywords are still unavailable to synth designs. This
will be relaxed in a future version.

#### MIDI

The MIDI API has been substantially revamped. This is in the Apple
tradition of actually reducing functionality with the aim of making the
surviving functionality easier to use. Essentially the underlying MIDI
library provided by the dependency `overtone/midi-clj` is no longer
available in the global API which is pulled in automatically to the
`overtone.live` and `overtone.core` namespaces. Of course, you're still
free to pull in the `overtone.midi` namespace, which is still on the
classpath should you need access to the old functions. However, if you
find yourself doing this - please let me know. The aim is for this not
to be necessary.

MIDI devices are now automatically detected on boot and auto-hooked up
to the event system. You have access to the list of detected devices
(and receivers) via the functions: `midi-connected-devices` and
`midi-connected-receivers`. Take a look at the example file
`examples/midi/basic.clj` for more a quick tour of the MIDI API.


#### Graphviz

If you're working on a sophisticated synth design, or just simply want
to have another perspective of a given synth's design, it's often useful
to be able to look at a visual representation. This is now possible with
the new Graphviz support. You can generate dot notation for an arbitrary
synth design with the function `graphviz`.

For example, given the synth:

    (defsynth foo []
      (out 0 (sin-osc 440)))

You can produce corresponding dot notation with:

    (graphviz foo)

Which will return the following string:

    digraph synthdef {
    1 [label = "{{ <bus> bus 0.0|{{<signals___sin____osc___0>}|signals}} |<__UG_NAME__>out }" style="filled, bold, rounded"  shape=record rankdir=LR];
    0 [label = "{{ <freq> freq 440.0|<phase> phase 0.0} |<__UG_NAME__>sin-osc }" style="filled, bold, rounded"  shape=record rankdir=LR];

    0:__UG_NAME__ -> 1:signals___sin____osc___0 ;

    }

You can then easily `spit` this out to a file and feed it into graphviz
to render an image/pdf etc manually. However, we also provide the
function `show-graphviz-synth` which will automatically call `dot` to
generate a pdf and then display it for you:

    (show-graphviz-synth foo) ;;=> PDF pops up!

This has been exhaustively tested on OS X, so any pull requests for
minor niggles on Linux/Windows are happily
considered. `show-graphviz-synth` is currently pretty much guaranteed
not to work on Windows, but it would be awesome if it did.

#### Bus monitoring

One aspect of Overtone which is seeing active development is means with
which to monitor the internal values within running synths. Overtone
0.9.0 now ships with a bus monitoring system which works with both audio
and control busses.

Calling `bus-monitor` with a bus will return an atom containing the
current value of the bus. Note that this isn't the peak amplitude,
rather the direct value of the control bus. For multi-channel buses, an
offset may be specified. Current amplitude is updated within the
returned atom every 50 ms.


#### Persistent store

Overtone now supports a simple persistent key value store which is
essentially a Clojure map serialised as EDN in file with the path
`~/.overtone/user-store.clj`. Adding to the store is a matter of
`store-set!` and getting values from it is simply `store-get`. The store
is meant merely as a simple convenience mechanism for sharing data
between Overtone projects.

#### Stopping and Clearing Default Group

Overtone has long provided `stop` which kills all synths in the default
group. However, it doesn't clear out all the subgroups which is
sometimes wanted. This is now available with `clear`. Overtone also
provides an initial group structure with 'safe' groups both before and
after the default group. These are intended for longer-running synths
either feeding control signals to ephemeral synths or adding FX to
them. These 'safe' groups can now be stopped with `stop-all` and also
all the subgroups can be cleared out with `clear-all`. For more
information on the default group structure see the `foundation-*` fns.

#### Node events

It's now possible to register oneshot handler function for when specific
nodes are created, destroyed, paused or started with the new `on-node-*`
family of functions. For example to have a function execute every time a
node is started:

    (defsynth foo [] (out 0 (sin-osc)))

    (def f (foo))

    (on-node-started f (fn [m] (println "Node"  (-> m :node :id) "started!")))
    (node-pause f)
    (node-start f) ;;=> "Node 31 started!"
    (node-pause f)
    (node-start f) ;;=> "Node 31 started!"

#### Synth Triggers

It is possible to send information out of a specific synth and into
Overtone as an event via the `send-trig` ugen. This is now a little bit
easier with the new trigger handler functions. Firstly, there's
`trig-id` which will return you a unique id for use as a trigger id. You
can then feed that to your synth and also use it to register handler
functions to execute when data from that specific synth is received:

    ;; create new id
    (def uid (trig-id))

    ;; define a synth which uses send-trig
    (defsynth foo [t-id 0] (send-trig (impulse 10) t-id (sin-osc)))

    ;; register a handler fn
    (on-trigger uid
                (fn [val] (println "trig val:" val))
                ::debug)

    ;; create a new instance of synth foo with trigger id as a param
    (foo uid)

#### Envelopes

Using envelopes effectively has long been a dark Overtone art. They have
a huge potential for powerful manipulation of synth internals to finely
control both pitch and timbre though time. The simplest approach to
using envelopes is using the `env-gen` helper fns such as `perc` and
`adsr`. These functions have supported keyword argument semantics
similar to the ugen functions given that they're used in the same
context. However, until this release, they haven't reported their param
list in the function argument list metadata. This is now fixed in this
release. In addition, to help ease discovery of these helper fns, they
are also now prefixed with `env-` so those using editors with
autocomplete can find them more easily. The helper functions provided in
0.9.0 are: `env-triangle`, `env-sine`, `env-perc`, `env-lin`,
`env-cutoff`, `env-dadsr`, `env-adsr` and `env-asr`.

The `envelope` function (which all the helper functions are written in
terms of) has also been improved. It is now possible to pass a
heterogeneous list of keywords and floats for the `curves`
parameter. This means that it's now possible to request different
keywords for different envelope segments. Take a look at the `envelope`
docstring for extensive information.

#### Resonate Workshop

Karsten 'Toxi' Schmidt has kindly donated his resonate workshop
files to the examples folder. These can be found within
`examples/workshops/resonate2013`. Karsten is renowned for giving
awesome workshops, so it's wonderful to be able to ship with this
material for everyone to play.

#### Docstrings

Although it can be fairly argued that Overtone is still missing end-user
documentation (something we're currently working hard at fixing) we have
always had excellent internal documentation and this release continues
with this tradition. All of our end-user functions have full docstrings
and many of them have been improved and tweaked to make them more
readable and understandable.

### Major Features

* New, all Clojure, in-memory scsynth interface using clj-native
* New (optionally disabled) machinery to stop the control and modification of non-live nodes (controlling loading nodes blocks the current thread and controlling destroyed nodes throws an exception).
* New event handler `on-latest-event`  which serially handles incoming events with the lowest latency by dropping events it hasn't had time to handle, yet always handling the last event seen.
* Complete overhaul of the default group structure. See `foundation-*` fns below.
* Many new synths
* Many, many new ugens: major progress has been made porting the metadata for the extra ugens not included by default in SuperCollider. See `overtone/sc/machinery/ugen/metadata/extras/README.md` for progress.
* Clojure 1.5 compatibility


### New fns
* `on-latest-event` - Handles events with minimum latency - drops events it can't handle in time
* `event-monitor-on` - prints out all events to stdout (can be very noisy!)
* `event-monitor-off` - turns off event monitoring
* `event-monitor-timer` - records incoming events for a specified period of time
* `event-monitor` - returns map of most recently recorded events
* `event-monitor-keys` - returns seq of all keys of recently seen events
* `midi-capture-next-controller-key` Returns the event key for the next modified controller
* `buffer-write-relay` - similar to buffer-write! but doesn't require native synth. Can be very slow for large amounts of data.
* `chord-degree` - Returns the notes constructed by picking thirds in the given note of a given scale
* `foundation-overtone-group` - returns the group for the whole of the Overtone foundational infrastructure
* `foundation-output-group` - returns the group for output synths
* `foundation-monitor-group` - returns the group for the monitor synths (executed last)
* `foundation-input-group` - returns the group for the input synths (executed first)
* `foundation-root-group` - returns the main group for synth activity
* `foundation-user-group` - returns the container group for user activity
* `foundation-default-group` - returns the default user group - use this group for your synths
* `foundation-safe-group` - returns the safe group - synths in here will not stop when #'stop is called
* `foundation-safe-post-default-group` - returns the safe group positioned before the default group - synths in here will not stop when #'stop is called
* `foundation-safe-pre-default-group` - returns the safe group positioned after the default group - synths in here will not stop when #'stop is called
* `node?` - returns true if obj is a synth node or group
* `node-live?` - returns true if node is live
* `node-loading?` - returns true if node is loading (i.e. the server hasn't responded to say that it's loaded)
* `node-active?` - returns true if node is either loading or live
* `inactive-node-modification-error` - Returns a keyword representing the current node-modification errors trategy
* `inactive-buffer-modification-error` - Returns a keyword representing the current buffer-modification error strategy
* `block-node-until-ready?` - Returns true if the current message strategy is to block the current thread until the node you're attempting to communicate with is ready (i.e. live).
* `pp-node-tree` - pretty-print the node-tree to *out*
* `interspaced` - calls a fn repeatedly with an interspacing of ms-period. i.e. the next call of the fn will happen ms-period ms after the completion of the previous call.

### New macros

* `with-no-ugen-checks` - Disables ugen checks in containing form instead printing warning messages instead of raising exceptions. This is useful for the cases when the ugen checks are over zealous.
* `with-ugen-debugging` - Prints debugging information for the ugens within the containing form.
* `without-node-blocking` - Disables the blocking behaviour when attempting to communicate with a node that's not yet live.
* `with-inactive-node-modification-error` - Sets the error strategy for inactive node modification. Options are :exception, :warning and :silent
* `with-inactive-buffer-modification-error` - Sets the error strategy for inactive buffer modification. Options are :exception, :warning and :silent
* `with-inactive-modification-error` - Sets the error strategy for both inactive node and buffer modification. Options are :exception, :warning and :silent

### Removed fns
* `on-trigger` - prefer event system
* `remove-trigger` - prefer event system
* `remove-all-handlers` - calling this removed Overtone's default handlers rendering the system useless.

* `add-cents` - Returns a frequency which is the result of adding n-cents to the src frequency.
* `mul-add` now auto-determins the correct rate.
* `range-lin` - maps ugens with default range of -1 to 1 to specified range
* `poll` - now implemented via `send-reply` to print out via Overtone stdout and remove flushing latency.

### User Visible Improvements

* Further work on SuperCollider book translation (`/docs/sc-book`)
* `out-bus` argument now added to a number of synths. This should be considered standard practice.
* Overtone icon displayed on OS X systems
* `tb303` inst now accepts `:amp` param
* Synth control proxies (args) can now accept a [default rate] vector i.e. [0 :kr]
* Allow following ugens to be foldable (following Clojure's semantics): `#{"+" "-" "*" "/" "<" ">" "<=" ">=" "min" "max" "and" "or"}`
* Teach certain binary ugens to behave appropriately if passed just one argument (unity).
* Default scsynth memory size is now 256 (up from 8mb!)
* `env-gen` now defaults to control rate.
* Event stream now also gets a generic MIDI event with the value as a payload rather than as part of the key
* Metronome now stores current bar
* Add chord `:m7+9`
* Buffer modifying fns now typically return the modified buffer
* MIDI data map now includes keys `:data2-f` and `:velocity2-f` storing floats between 0 and 1
* Add more scales
* Ugen arity and keys are now checked with sensible error messages.
* Allow samples to be forcefully reloaded - avoiding cache with via supplying the `:force` arg to `load-sample`
* Midi poly player now sends both velocity (0-127) and amp (0-1)
* Midi poly player can now be associated with specific MIDI devices
* Midi poly player can now be created with a specific key allowing it to be removed independently
* Teach group fn to ensure that the target node is active.
* teach Overtone OSC peer to throw exceptions when nested OSC bundles are attempted to be sent to SuperCollider (despite being an explicit part of the OSC spec, SuperCollider doesn't support nested OSC bundles).
* Rename buffer record slot allocated-on-server to status containing either :live or :destroyed similar to node records.
* Add print-method writers for buffers and samples
* Update scope to support control-rate buses and to free resources created on closing the scope
* Teach buffers to store descriptive names
* Ensure buffer is active before allowing modifications - may be disabled
* Add deref! description messages to improve the error reporting by providing some context when a deref! takes too long.
* Improved MIDI sysex support: can now receive sysex messages, which are placed onto the event stream
* Ability to handle multiple identical connected MIDI devices
* Support for the mmj lib (on OS X) via the config key `:use-mmj`
* Add ability to handle bus, buffer (and other) arguments in synth creation and control messages without requiring explicit :id extraction
* New `~/.overtone/config.clj` example documenting all config options. Found in `docs/config.clj`

### Internal Improvements

* SCUGen now stores the ugen spec
* SynthNodes now store the original synth design and arguments
* SynthNodes and SynthGroups now print themselves succintly
* Mixers are now part of studio
* Many additional ugen checks
* `group-node-tree` now knows how to handle a group as a param
* `extract-target-pos-args` extraced for `:tgt` and `:pos` munging.
* Allow for different JVM args per OS
* Extend Integers to handle `ISynthNode` and `IControllableNode` protocols
* Fixed race condition in node creation where `/s_new` could occasionally trigger the handler fn before the ide id is added to `active-synth-nodes*`
* Synth names are now namespaced - allowing multiple synths to be defined with the same name but in different namespaces. Abbreviate safely to a 31 character limit.
* Teach `synthdef-write` to resolve tilde paths
* Internal event `:osc-msg-received` is now `[:overtone :osc-msg-received]`
* Freeing node ids is delayed by 1 second to reduce the chance of a race condition occurring in the case where the id has been recycled and used before the node status has been set to :destroyed.
* Add dynamic var `overtone.sc.node/*inactive-node-modification-error*` which may be bound to `:silent`, `:warning` or `:exception` to control the behaviour of the error created when an inactive node is either controlled or killed.  (Default is `:exception`).
* Teach insts how about node-status and node-block-until-ready. For insts, this is really composite behaviour depending on internal groups and synths.
* Move to using non-id-recycling keywords for node and buffer ids. (Thanks to Kevin Neaton for discovering that this was possible). IDs *will* run out, but only after a solid 24 hours of hardcore jamming.
* add new `os-name` and `os-description` helper fns
* update `osc-clj` dependency (which now supports nested OSC bundles in the macro `in-osc-bundle`) and move to using the new non-nested osc bundle macro `in-unested-osc-bundle` to explicitly not create OSC bundles for SC comms. However, the nested bundle functionality may be useful for communicating with other OSC servers which support this behaviour (which is in the OSC spec).
