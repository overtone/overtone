;;; Read me, and evaluate line by line as you go.  To evaluate a form highlight it with the mouse
;;; and type <control-e>, using the "e" for evaluate.  The repl window below will show the output

;;; have doc strings.  Try evaluating these:

; In order to play samples instantly they have to be in memory.  (You use memory
; buffers for other synths too, for example in an echo effect.)

; Load a sample into a buffer. You'll need to change this file path to point to a
; wav file on your machine.

; Now the audio data for the sample is loaded into a buffer.  You can view the buffer in the
