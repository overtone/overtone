# Collaborative Programmable Music.

## A Live-programmable music exploration & collaboration toolkit.

Overtone is an Open Source toolkit for designing synthesizers and collaborating with music.  It provides:

* A Clojure API to the SuperCollider synthesis engine
* A growing library of musical functions (scales, chords, rhythms, arpeggiators, etc.)
* Metronome and timing system to support live-programming and sequencing
* Plug and play MIDI device I/O
* Simple Open Sound Control (OSC) message handling
* Pre-cache - a system for locally caching external assets such as .wav files
* An API for querying and fetching sounds from http://freesound.org

## Quick Setup


### Installation

```sh
    # Install lein
    # https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

    $ lein new insane-noises

    # add the following dependencies to insane-noises/project.clj
    # [org.clojure/clojure "1.3.0"]
    # [overtone "0.6.0"]

    $ cd insane-noises
    $ lein deps
```

### Server Option A: Internal

```sh
    # Linux users - start jackd
    # (see https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Installing-and-starting-jack)

    $ lein repl
```
```clj
    user=> (use 'overtone.live)
```

### Server Option B: External

```sh
    # Download and install SuperCollider:
    # http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/

    $ lein repl
```
```clj
    user=> (use 'overtone.core)
    user=> (boot-external-server)
```

```clj
    ; sin-osc creates a sine wave at the specified Hz (440 in this case)
    ; and pan2 makes the signal stereo
    ; demo simply plays the synth for the specified time in seconds:

    user=> (demo 5 (pan2 (sin-osc 440)))

    ; Defining a new synthesizer instrument with the definst macro will return a
    ; function which can be used to trigger the inst.

    user=> (definst beep [freq 440] (sin-osc freq))
    user=> (beep)
    user=> (stop) ; (this command will kill all running synths)

    ; Call the ctl function to modulate any params and to eventually kill that instrument:

    user=> (beep)
    user=> (ctl beep :freq 880)
    user=> (kill beep) ; (this will just kill the specific instrument)
```

## Documentation

### Detailed Setup Instructions

For a more detailed set of setup instructions (including details specific to Windows and Linux) head over to the [Overtone wiki installation page](https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Installing-Overtone)

### Getting Started

We will try to maintain documentation for all aspects of the system in the [project wiki](https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Home), you'll find tutorials and examples on topics such as synthesizing new sounds from scratch, live-coding and generating musical scores on the fly. If you see anything missing, please feel free to add it yourself, or hit us up on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/overtone) and we'll sort somethign out.

## External & Internal Servers

Overtone supports both internal and external instances of `scsynth` - the SuperCollider server. The internal server is good for quick setup (there are no external dependencies to install and allows fast access to server buffers for transferring sound data and using the scopes). The external server requires a separate installation of SuperCollider itself but is more robust in that crashes in the server (through malformed synth designs etc.) don't also crash the JVM (which is the case for the internal server). It is also possible to connect multiple separate clients to an already running external scsynth instance.

Note - the internal server is not currently supported for all architecture/operating system combinations. However, the external server should work everywhere.
