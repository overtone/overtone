;;This is an annotated version of this synth definition to help in understanding
;; some basics about synths and the synthdef data structure used in Overtone.

;; Here is a basic kick drum.  An envelope generator is multiplied by a low frequency
;; sin wave, which is like turning the volume knob up and down really quick while playing
;; a low tone.
(defsynth kick [amp 0.5 decay 0.6 freq 65]
  (let [env (env-gen (perc 0 decay) 1 1 0 1 FREE)
        snd (sin-osc freq (* Math/PI 0.5) amp)]
    (out 0 (pan2 (* snd env) 0))))

;; This can be triggered using the name as a function call:
(kick)

;; A shorter variation using definst which allows you to leave out the out and pan ugens,
;; which get added by default to synths that are rooted by an audio rate ugen that isn't out.
(definst kick [amp 0.5 decay 0.6 freq 65]
  (* (sin-osc freq (* Math/PI 0.5) amp)
     (env-gen (perc 0 decay) 1 1 0 1 FREE)))

;; Similarly this is also triggered using the name as a function call:
(kick)

;; The defsynth function will create a synthesizer definition structure that mimics the
;; binary format sent to the SuperCollider server.  These could also be created in other
;; ways, for example if you have in idea for a synthesizer DSL...

;; The structure is stored in each synth you create in a key called :sdef. So to retrieve
;; the structure of our kick synth we need to issue:
(:sdef kick)

;; This might be improved by pretty printing the result:
(synthdef-print (:sdef kick))

;; Here is the annotated output of (:sdef kick)
(pprint (:sdef kick))
