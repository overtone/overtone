  the number total number of sounds without realizing the entire seq.

  Examples:

  Search for sounds matching the query \"kick drum\"

   (freesound-search :q \"kick drum\")
   (freesound-search \"kick drum\") ;same as above.

  Use a keyseq to filter the results per #'clojure.core/get-in

   (freesound-search [:id] \"kick drum\")

  Get just the ids for all of the sounds in the pack called \"MISStereoPiano\"
  matching the query \"LOUD\".

   (freesound-search [:id] \"LOUD\" :f \"pack:MISStereoPiano\"
