;; * Each note in a scale acts as either a generator or a collector of other notes,
;; depending on their relations in time within a sequence.
;;  - How can this concept be developed into parameterized sequences with knobs for
;;  adjusting things like tension, dissonance, swing, genre (latin, asian, arabic...)
;;  - Can we develop a symbol language or visual representation so that someone could compose
;;  a piece by using mood tokens rather than specifying scales and notes directly?  Basically,
;;  generator functions would have to choose the scales, chords, notes and rhythm based on
;;  a mix of looking up aspects of the mood, and informed randomness.

;; Use a note (:C scale) or (:Eb scale)

;;  You may be interested to know that each of the seven degrees of the diatonic scale has its own name:
;;
;; 1 (do)  tonic
;; 2 (re)  supertonic
;; 3 (mi)  mediant
;; 4 (fa)  subdominant
;; 5 (sol) dominant
;; 6 (la)  submediant/superdominant
;; 7 (ti)  subtonic"


;; Various scale intervals in terms of steps on a piano, or midi note numbers
