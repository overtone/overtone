;; ## Allocators
;;
;; We use bit sets to store the allocation state of resources
;; on the audio server.  These typically get allocated on usage by the client,
;; and then freed either by client request or automatically by receiving
;; notifications from the server.  (e.g. When an envelope trigger fires to
;; free a synth.)
