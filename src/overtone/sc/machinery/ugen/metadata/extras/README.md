# Extra Ugens

These ugens are from the SC3 Plugins project:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/sc3-plugins/

## Status

Metadata for these ugens needs to be created for them to be available from Overtone. This is an ongoing process. Here's a status chart of this work:

    [ ] = Not Started
    [P] = Partially complete
    [*] = Complete

    Where a ugen set is marked P, a sublist of the ugens missing
    metadata is given.
