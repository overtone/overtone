   Nonlinear oscillators can blow up, treat with caution. This one is relatively stable however, converging to a fixed point, or a limit cycle, in the upper positive quadrant for some reasonable values. Just be careful if mu gets much bigger than gamma (though making it larger is necessary to get some chaotic oscillation behaviour) you can retrigger to get back to normal, and keep the rate lower to avoid Euler integration blow-ups. You may just need to scale and push down around zero to avoid a DC offset. Fixed point is at (x,y = (gamma, mu/gamma))"}
