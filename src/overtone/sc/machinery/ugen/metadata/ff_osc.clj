Generally the amplitude will go down as you raise the frequency and go up as you lower the frequency.

  WARNING: In the current implementation, the amplitude can blow up if the frequency is modulated by certain alternating signals."}

  WARNING: This waveform in its raw form could be damaging to your ears at high amplitudes or for long periods.

  It is improved from other implementations in that it will crossfade in a control period when the number of harmonics changes, so that there are no audible pops. It also eliminates the divide in the formula by using a 1/sin table (with special precautions taken for 1/0).  The lookup tables are linearly interpolated for better quality.

  Synth-O-Matic (1990) had an impulse generator called blip, hence that name here rather than 'buzz'."}
