  who have registered via the /notify command .

  The following two arguments are only sent if the node is a group:
   int - the ID of the head node, -1 if there is no head node.
   int - the ID of the tail node, -1 if there is no tail node.

   /n_go   - a node was created

   /n_off  - a node was turned off
