  who have registered via the /notify command .

  All of these have the same arguments:
   int - node ID
   int - the node's parent group ID
   int - previous node ID, -1 if no previous node.
   int - next node ID, -1 if no next node.
   int - 1 if the node is a group, 0 if it is a synth

  The following two arguments are only sent if the node is a group:
   int - the ID of the head node, -1 if there is no head node.
   int - the ID of the tail node, -1 if there is no tail node.

   /n_go   - a node was created
   /n_end  - a node was destroyed
   /n_on   - a node was turned on
   /n_off  - a node was turned off
   /n_move - a node was moved
