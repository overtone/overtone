;; ## Busses
;;
;; Synthesizers can be connected to I/O devices (e.g. sound cards) and
;; other synthesizers by using busses.  Conceptually they are like
;; plugging a cable from the output of one unit to the input of another,
;; but in SC they are implemented using a simple integer referenced
;; array of float values.
