   "Here we use dibrown to create an infinite sequence of values between 0 and max where each successive value is a whole number no more than step plus or minus the last value. This creates a walk-like effect. We then pull out the values from dibrown using the demand ugen, pulling at the rate defined by the impulse - which is between 1 and 40 depending on the mouse-x coord. Therefore, you can use the mouse to speed up and slow down the walk.

   We poll the current value so you can see the output as well as hear it"
