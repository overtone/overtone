   "Use compander to create a noise gate"
   "Here we have a fairly interesting original sound which we pass through a noise gate created by a compander. This is created by having a steep slope-below curve which cuts off quiet input signals. The slope above the threshold is 1 which means that when the input signal is above the threshold, it isn't modified.

  Move the mouse from left to right to increase the threshold. Notice how more of the sound is affected the further right you go.

  Move the mouse from up to down to increase the slope below the threshold. Notice how the modification of the sound is increased the further down you go.

  Also, try setting mix-val to -1 to hear the original sound unmodified."

Start by modifying the below value, say to 3. Notice how the value is only affected when it is below the threshold i.e. above the threshold the out val should be the same as the in val. Below the threshold the out value should be less than the in. Try increasing the below value and notice how the effect is magnified.
