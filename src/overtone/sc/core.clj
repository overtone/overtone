;;
;; The following two arguments are only sent if the node is a group:
;;   int - the ID of the head node, -1 if there is no head node.
;;   int - the ID of the tail node, -1 if there is no tail node.
;;
;;   /n_go   - a node was created
;;   /n_end  - a node was destroyed
;;   /n_on   - a node was turned on
;;   /n_off  - a node was turned off
;;   /n_move - a node was moved
;;   /n_info - in reply to /n_query
