The underlying model assumes 4/4, but it should work on any isochronous beat structure, though there are biases to 100-120 bpm; a fast 7/8 may not be tracked in that sense. There are four k-rate outputs, being ticks at quarter, eighth and sixteenth level from the determined beat, and the current detected tempo. Note that the sixteenth note output won't necessarily make much sense if the music being tracked has swing; it is provided just as a convenience.

This beat tracker determines the beat, biased to the midtempo range by weighting functions. It does not determine the measure level, only a tactus. It is also slow reacting, using a 6 second temporal window for its autocorrelation maneouvres. Don't expect human musician level predictive tracking.

On the other hand, it is tireless, relatively general (though obviously best at transient 4/4 heavy material without much expressive tempo variation), and can form the basis of computer processing that is decidedly faster than human. "}

This beat tracker is based on exhaustively testing particular template patterns against feature streams; the testing takes place every 0.5 seconds. The two basic templates are a straight (groove=0) and a swung triplet (groove=1) pattern of 16th notes; this pattern is tried out at scalings corresponding to the tempi from 60 to 180 bpm. This is the cross-corellation method of beat tracking. A majority vote is taken on the best tempo detected, but this must be confirmed by a consistency check after a phase estimate. Such a consistency check helps to avoid wild fluctuating estimates, but is at the expense of an additional half second delay. The latency of the beat tracker with default settings is thus at least 2.5 seconds; because of block-based amortisation of calculation, it is actually around 2.8 seconds latency for a 2.0 second temporal window.

This beat tracker is designed to be flexible for user needs; you can try out different window sizes, tempo weights and combinations of features. However, there are no guarantees on stability and effectiveness, and you will need to explore such parameters for a particular situation.    "}

The optional third argument interpolate specifies whether interpolation should be used to try and make the percentile frequency estimate more accurate, at the cost of a little higher CPU usage. Set it to 1 to enable this."}
