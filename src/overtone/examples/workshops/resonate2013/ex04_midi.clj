;; Here we define a map of MIDI notes to samples
;; You can use any freesound.org sample you wish, just change
;; the sample IDs found on the website
;; Samples will be downloaded automatically and cached in
;; the .overtone directory in your user/home folder

;; First let's see which MIDI devices are connected...
(connected-midi-devices)

;; this will open a dialog asking you to choose a connected device
;; only devices already connected *prior* to launching Overtone are recognized

;; MIDI is event based...
;; For drums we only are interested in :note-on events
;; emitted when a key on any connected device is pressed
