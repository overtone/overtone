;; This next function uses a few new concepts:

;; 2) It uses so called let-bindings, local symbol definitions which are only existing within
;;    the scope of let's body (in this case, the constructed `play` fn)
;; 3) The play-phrases-1 fn uses variable argument counts, allowing us to specify any number of phrases

;; continue separating concerns: pattern repetition vs. pattern playback...

;; So far, play-phrases still is doing more than one thing and we can
;; refactor it further by splitting out and increasing the flexibility of
;; the pattern/phrase generation. More flexibility can be obtained by
;; allowing us to specify the root note as absolute value, e.g. :c4 or

;; To ease the combination of shorter phrases into longer ones,

  repeat-phrases on each. Concatenates all into a single flat seq."

  ;; Since all our patterns are made of sequences of 4 notes, we can use the

;; Since our note phrases are just sequences of numbers, we can apply the same
;; functions we've built on our rhythmic phrases too. Below we construct a more
;; complex rhythmic pattern (using 0 as an offset to keep the original values)

;; The next function is used to compute start times for all notes in a phrase

;; Notable things:
;; 1) We use the ->> threading syntax again to describe the transformation of
;;    how the rhythm is applied to our melody
;; 2) The (cycle) fn produces an infinite repetition of the given sequence:
;;    E.g. (cycle [1 2]) => (1 2 1 2 1 2 ...)
;; 3) Since we are only interested in a finite amount of notes, we use (take)
;;    to only take the first x items from that infinite sequence (without it
;;    the machine would freeze :)
;; 4) We also use (reductions) again to build up a sequence of increasing timestamps.
;;    The last argument (0) is the time offset for the first note
;;    This timing sequence is then combined with the notes in the (map) fn
