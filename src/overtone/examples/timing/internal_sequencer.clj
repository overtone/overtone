;; A fully server-side sample sequencer.
;; =====================================

;; This example demonstrates some of the benefits of moving all synth
;; triggers inside the server itself. For example, it allows you to
;; modify the synthesis with *immediate* effect (rather than waiting for
;; the next bar/chunk to be scheduled) and you can use a global pulse to
;; drive both the timing and to also modulate aspects of the synthesis
;; so that the modulations are sympathetic to the rhythms being played.

;; First, let's create some sequencer buffers for specifying which beat
;; to trigger a sample. This will be our core data structure for a basic
;; emulation of an 8-step sequencer. A buffer is like a Clojure vector,
;; except it lives on the server and may only contain floats. Buffers
;; are initialised to have all values be 0.0

(defonce buf-0 (buffer 8))
(defonce buf-1 (buffer 8))
(defonce buf-2 (buffer 8))
(defonce buf-3 (buffer 8))

;; Next let's create some timing buses. These can be visualised as
;; 'patch cables' - wires that carry pulse signals that may be
;; arbitrarily forked and fed into any synth that wants to be aware of
;; the pulses. We have two types of information being conveyed here -
;; firstly the trg buses contain a stream of 0s with an intermittant 1
;; every time there is a tick. Secondly we have the cnt buses which
;; contain a stream of the current tick count. We then have two of each
;; type of bus - one for a high resolution global metronome, and another
;; for a division of the global metronome for our beats.

(defonce root-trg-bus (control-bus)) ;; global metronome pulse
(defonce root-cnt-bus (control-bus)) ;; global metronome count
(defonce beat-trg-bus (control-bus)) ;; beat pulse (fraction of root)
(defonce beat-cnt-bus (control-bus)) ;; beat count

(def BEAT-FRACTION "Number of global pulses per beat" 30)

;; Here we design synths that will drive our pulse buses.
(defsynth root-trg [rate 100]
  (out:kr root-trg-bus (impulse:kr rate)))

(defsynth root-cnt []
  (out:kr root-cnt-bus (pulse-count:kr (in:kr root-trg-bus))))

(defsynth beat-trg [div BEAT-FRACTION]

(defsynth beat-cnt []
