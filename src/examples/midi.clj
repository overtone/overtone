; Calling midi-in without any arguments will bring up a swing dialog to choose
; from available midi devices.  Note that Java does not seem to detect midi devices
; after JVM startup (at least on OSX), so you USB midi device will need to be connected
; before starting Overtone.

;(def keyboard (midi-in))

; The low level midi handler mechanism from midi-clj uses midi-handle-events,
; which takes a device ; and a midi player function that will receive midi
; event maps.

;(midi-handle-events keyboard #'midi-player)

; overtone.studio.midi now includes the beginnings of a higher level midi interface
; that helps improve on this.  By default Overtone will detect and listen to all
; midi input devices.  These midi messages are then sent as events, which can be received
; with the Overtone event system.

; For example, print out all incoming note-on messages:

;(on-event [:midi :note-on] (fn [{note :note velocity :velocity}]
;                             (println "Note: " note ", Velocity: " velocity))
;          ::note-printer)

;(remove-handler ::note-printer)

; Other available midi events are:
; * :channel-pressure
; * :control-change
; * :note-off
; * :note-on
; * :pitch-bend
; * :poly-pressure
; * :program-change

; In order to play instruments that continue playing until a key is released,
; we need to keep track of each active synth instance once triggered by :note-on,
; and then send a control message to either kill it or close the gate on an
; envelope so the release starts.  This is what overtone.studio.midi/midi-poly-player
; does for you.  All it requires is that you have exposed an envelope gate as a synth
; parameter called "gate".

; Create a polyphonic midi player:
;(def ding-player (midi-poly-player poly-ding))
